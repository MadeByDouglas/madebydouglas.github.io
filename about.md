Hello and welcome!

This is my digital resume similar to what is found on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/madebydouglas)

Please check out my repos at [GitHub](https://github.com/MadeByDouglas) &nbsp; and my [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4531087/audentiaa) &nbsp; account.

You can also check out a quick interview of me from 3 years ago at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/ios-bootcamp), (it's at the bottom) where I learned to code iOS.

While on those other sites I remain professional and to the point, here I'd like to keep the atmosphere a bit more personal. So you'll find similar work examples and a great focus on UX Design and iOS Development, but also side projects of mine and insights into who I am.

A quick manifesto: I love when ingenuity and craftsmanship combine to create products that improve people’s lives and I find that in iOS. I’m eager to be part of a team where I can contribute my talents and learn from those around me. I believe businesses have the unique opportunity and responsibility to improve the lives of everyone they contact,&nbsp; whether it be their customers,&nbsp; employees,&nbsp; or the environment.
