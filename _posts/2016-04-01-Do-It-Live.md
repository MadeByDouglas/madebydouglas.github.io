# Do It Live
## Summary
Do It Live is a simple camera app that lets you take pictures and post them to social media instantly. It was my own idea and side project that I built for fun. It was partly to show what I could build with a custom camera module and `AVFoundation` and also just a fun idea to have people take the risk of snapping a photo and post it online immediately. I also built the [landing page](http://www.doitliveapp.com "Do It Live"){:target="_blank"} for the app, which links to the [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/do-it-live/id1092465569?mt=8){:target="_blank"}.
The app has more than 3000 installs which grew organically, so there is something to the idea. I would like to go back and tweak the features in the future to make posting less stressful and discover cool photographs near your current location.
