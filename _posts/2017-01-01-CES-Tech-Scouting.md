# CES 2017 - Tech Scouting
## Smart Helmets
### Consumer Convenience and Construction Safety
One clear trend of CES for the last several years has been the idea of “smart things.” Basically, add local and internet connectivity to various devices so they can talk to each other to make your life better. Everything from your  coffee cup to your toothbrush is now “connected,” so why not your bicycle helmet? That’s whats coming next as the advancements in low powered bluetooth and augmented reality tech are combining to form a category of smart helmets. There were several on the show floor this year, for both consumer and workplace environments.
Two interesting bicycle helmets were the Coros LINX https://www.coros.com and Lumos helmet https://lumoshelmet.co that both tackle different challenges. The Coros uses bone conducting speaker technology to send calls and music to your ears without blocking ambient traffic noise for rider safety. The Lumos pairs with  a wireless remote and tracks acceleration to give you turn signals and braking indicator.
For industrial applications DAQRI  https://daqri.com/products/ has build a smart construction helmet. It has an onboard intel processor, thermal cameras, and a transparent LCD augmented reality system. The idea is to enhance workers inspecting or working on various industrial applications. The main example they gave was feeding the thermal camera video feed directly into the AR screens so the worker can see how hot various items are just by looking at them allowing him to working a natural and efficient way.

## Virtual and Augmented Reality
### Wireless, 360 Degree Cameras, Tracking and finally 8k for VR  
This year’s CES was again a big year for VR and less, but also for AR technology.
Not only was the show floor bigger but also the exhibitors were more diverse and therefore offered a brought view into the future.

Some highlights were the first 8k VR headset (by PiMAX’s) with a broad FOV (200 Degree) as well as a 5k headset with tracking up to 20 people per 10x10m. The first was unfortunately without tracking, nor were the optics good - so that the picture was very sharp (very little “grid effect”) but still quite blurry and poor in contrast. The latter of the two headset offered a great immersive experience and was offered by the company StarVR, which is responsible for the VR IMAX experiences and is currently setting up a demo room in Paris. Also on the headset side there was the company DloDlo Tech, showcasing a VR headset in the shape of regular sun glasses. Limited by the field of view and resolution, as well as comfort it still showcased how small VR technology can become in the future.

Another interesting thing was an RGB Camera only based inside out-tracking. Which was showcased by Carl Zeiss. It was very shaky and needed unique structured surfaces, but it was still very impressive and ran on a regular Apple iPhone.
In general, you could see many 360 Degree cameras for VR as well as “tracking technology”. For example by the company Occipital, an add-on for your iPad that adds similar sensors like the Microsoft Hololens, or the company NOLO showed VR Motion Tracking system for semi-mobile VR systems.

One of the big players HTC show cased a new “tracking dongle”, called Vive Tracker which you can mount on any device and track it in VR through the Valve’s Lighthouse Technology. On top of that they showed the TP-Cast which enabled the Vive to operate wirelessly for 2-3hrs. Very useful for the BMW Group internally as well as event application and so on.
Also some little accessories were shown, which increased the overall comfort and ergonomics of the device.

Osterhout design group (ODG) had perhaps the most impressive Augmented Reality demo, but it still felt challenging to think of wearing these daily. Perhaps for specific industrial applications but for the average consumer it still needs a lot of work despite the praise from the press.

## TVs
### 3D is dead, 4K+HDR is here and ready, 8K on the horizon
New HDTVs always make a big splash at CES and this year was no exception. Perhaps the most exciting were the amazingly thin new OLED screens from Sony, Panasonic and LG. OLED, a different screen technology from LED LCD, allows better colors, motion, and uses less  power to provide a great picture. HDR, (high dynamic range) a technology that dynamically adjusts brightness across the screen to make colors really pop, adds to the effect of a more lifelike picture. These screens have been around in smartphones for a while, and LG used them for TVs last year, but now other manufacturers are joining the fray.
LG also showcased more flexible OLED displays, which could have interesting applications for in-car infotainment design. Meanwhile Sony demoed a special screen technology for very large screens for stages and cities. This tech would allow someone to build large 100 feet screens for stage events or stores with detail and brightness that projectors can’t match.
Another update was on 8K TVs and HDMI 2.1, the cable with enough bandwidth to power them. 8K quadruples the pixel count from 4K (just like 4K did from 1080p), providing more clarity. This is particularly important for large sizes over 70 inches. The first 8K broadcast happened earlier in 2016 during the Rio Olympic Games where NHK set up special viewing centers in 8k around Tokyo, Japan. The plan is to have 8K ready for a wide rollout for the the 2020 Olympics which take place in Tokyo.

## Robots
### Friendly AI showcase how we feel about bots, hint at what's to come
There were many drones and robots of all kinds at CES, but what stood out was the focus on friendly robots. There were many examples of simple childlike robots meant to be friendly and inviting to users to interact with.
None of them seemed particularly useful, but they did convey an important message to get more people to trust robotic assistance. This may be important changing people’s perspectives as robot assistants become more powerful and commonplace.
One example was the Olly, https://heyolly.com a little device that isn’t focused on its feature list so much as its focused on its personality. They claim it has AI that will get to know you as an individual, so your Olly will interact with you in a unique way.
It feels more like a showcase for their adaptive AI algorithms than a useful product, but at the very least is a sign of what’s coming.


## Cars
### Prototypes and Ideas
A writeup of CES 2017 is certainly not complete without mentioning Faraday Future. They unveiled a prototype of their first production car, the FF91. Certainly not without outrageous claims or stage difficulties (it failed to drive itself off stage) it nonetheless represents a look at the future of the car. The industry seems to agree the future will be electric and autonomous.
The Faraday has assembled a lot of the puzzle pieces together, but it still looks like a science project rather than the production ready vehicle they claim it is. That being said, most of the automotive companies focused on concepts rather than production ready vehicles. Nissan talked about a future Leaf which will be autonomous, and Honda shows a concept called the NeuV which is a small 2 seater autonomous car useful for quick trips around the city.

## Qualcomm
### New chips to power AR, and 5G is coming
The highlight at Qualcomm was their new SoC, the Snapdragon 835. This is built on a new 10nm process, offers more performance and battery life of course, and comes packaged with their new custom-built X16 modem.
The relevance of all this is the chip is designed to fit new form factors other than mobile phones, and its powerful enough to power AR solutions. So, for example the ODG designed AR glasses mentioned earlier runs on this new SoC.
Another thing they showed off was the integration with Google’s Project Tango, which is a solution for using specialized cameras on smart phones to map real environments into virtual environments in real time. This allows for AR within the phone screen and can transfer objects from the real world into the virtual world including their accurate dimensions. The first two phones that use this software from Google are powered by Qualcomm.

## Intel
### Partnerships and new platforms
Intel primarily showcased its partnerships and were its chips are being used rather than bleeding edge new chip technology. There were plenty of laptops everywhere at the show using Kaby lake, their newest generation i7, i5, and i3 processors, but that is a relatively minor upgrade. Otherwise they showcased Microsoft HoloLens and had a BMW i8 on display.
They had some more abstract AR demos for a car windshield showing possible uses for AR in the car, particularly a autonomous car. Obstacle avoidance, navigation, and messaging all in the windshield.

## Nuance
### Conversational Speech and deep OEM integration
They showed off their updated speech recognition that is powered by a more advanced AI. They promoted its natural communication abilities and integration with OEMs. It didn't seem any more impressive than what Google or Apple or Amazon offer, but they emphasized their willingness to integrate with our cars at a very deep level. So, if a user asks for parking spaces, and the car is electric, it will automatically favor spaces with charging stations.

## Bosch
### Connected Car and personal assistant
Showed a demo of car switching between autonomous and manual mode with lots of screens, to be honest the whole setup seemed a bit overwhelming. They also had a demo of a home “smart mirror” that can send navigation destinations from your car.
Finally one demo showcasing their vision for a connected car, showed a voice assistant that knows which passenger is talking to it so it could deliver more accurate responses. Strangely, they decided to render this digital assistant in a photo realistic style which left a rather unnerving impression of this realistic yet clearly not real person staring at you in the car while you ride. For those familiar with the issue of the “uncanny valley” when representing the human form, this fell right into that pitfall.

## Conti
### Cloud data and Infotainment
Showcased a variety of technologies they hope to integrate into vehicles. Most of the cloud data seemed a bit abstract and it was not clear what a production solution would look like, but they also had interesting car infotainment prototypes. They showed the value of an OLED screen used in the dash. Because OLED screens can be totally black, it lets you as a car designer define the whatever shape shape you want and not be limited to rectangles. This provided a nice experience if used as the screen behind the steering wheel.

## HERE
### Better maps with big data
They emphasized all the data points they have to collect more data and how that improves the user experience. They showcased a demo where cars can update each other in real time using the HERE cloud, and parking spaces can be determined by cars driving around roads. Still, it will take some time before enough cars have this on the road to make the results reliable.
## Harman
### Speakers and advanced AR HUDs
Showcased bluetooth speaker that integrates with ones built into the car, the music goes to the bluetooth speaker when you take it out automatically. They also had an Oasis autonomous car concept showing off their vision for the future of the car interior. It was relatively similar to ours, offering a spacious feeling emphasizing the feeling rather than any specific features.
A highlight of that was the Oasis WayRay, advanced AR windshield HUD. What was impressive about this was it was actually working, not just a concept, and they claim when its ready for production will support full RGB color. It showcased navigation and highlight objects in realtime as the car drove past items.

## Sony
### Cameras and user tracking
They showed advanced camera sensors for autonomous driving and environment awareness. Some of the impressive technical notes included accurate flicker removal with HDR, giving digital rear view mirrors a premium and usefully clear look at the outside world. This also helps autonomous driving algorithms accurately detect objects.
In addition they had an inside camera for tracking occupants. Called the depthsense camera, it knows if the driver is facing forward, looking at the road, and other things like that. It can track complex gestures and map things in real time and import them to the VR environment like Google’s Project Tango.

## Microsoft
### Cortana in the car
They focused on the integration of Cortana with the car, and did not reveal much else. They had their HoloLens on display as well, but didn't showcase anything new.

## Takata
### Haptic Sensors and Infotainment
Showed a new series of seat sensors that can detect passenger from driver. This does this by using the body as a way to send small packets of data. So, when the driver touches his cell phone or infotainment systems certain actions are locked, but when the passenger touches those same things they can be used. This can be used with or without cameras in the cabin tracking the occupants as well. They also had an eye tracking camera which knows if the user is looking at the road or not.
Finally they also had haptic buttons that can be built without gaps. These use use force not capacitive touch so can be installed on any surface and can be used with gloves. This provided for a rather nice experience when placing them on wood trim or on the steering wheel.
There was also a steering wheel which can disconnect from steering column so autonomous mode does not physically move the wheel. It can auto calibrate if it gets misaligned. They also showed concepts with embedded lights in the steering wheel or above using OLEDs for various notifications.
