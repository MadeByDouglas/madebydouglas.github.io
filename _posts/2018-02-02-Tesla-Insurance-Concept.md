# Tesla Insurance Concept

I built and mocked a pitch for a better insurance utilizing the data from Tesla vehicles. The idea is to use data from the vehicles to generate more accurate risk models which in turn can reduce prices for customers while keeping a safe profit margin for Tesla. Hoping to connect with employees at Tesla or Liberty Mutual to make this a reality. You can see the site and give feed back at [SparkCoverage.com](http://sparkcoverage.com){:target="_blank"}
